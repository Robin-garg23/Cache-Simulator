# Cache-Simulator

We needed to simulate all three types of cache mapping. I have used JAVA language to simulate mappings in my program.

There are three different types of Cache Mapping:

Direct Mapping
Fully Associative Mapping
N- way Set Associative Mapping
How to run the simulation:

First, we need to enter the Number of Cache lines and Block Size of Cache. Then we’ll specify the type of mapping we are going to use.

★All the numerical inputs are in power of 2. 
★To write into the cache we’ll need the address of memory location which can be either of lengths 16,32,64. 
★P.S.- The user is required to provide all the inputs in the specified format only to run the program correctly.
